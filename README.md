# shinell-works

This project consists of the code used to build my personal portfolio website. It is built upon my [boilerplate-cra-nodejs](https://github.com/shinellm/boilerplate-cra-nodejs) project, which has a [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) frontend and a custom Node backend (server for API, proxy, & routing).
